// A shopping list has to work standing in a shop with no signal, and a prep
// plan has to work on a train. So what the library knows about a dish travels
// WITH the plan rather than being fetched when needed — the same reason sets
// and macros are already captured rather than looked up.
//
// The logic that CONSUMES this lives in @ava/core (health/shopping-list,
// health/prep) so the extension and the IDE read the same rules. Only the
// mapping from this surface's catalogue shapes belongs here — and the IDE's
// shapes match the extension's field for field, so the two mappings agree.
