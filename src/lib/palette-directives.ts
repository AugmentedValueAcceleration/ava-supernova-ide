// ─── Command palette directive builder (IDE) ─────────────────────────────────
//
// Mirror of the extension's src/webview/palette-directives.ts. Duplicated
// rather than shared because the IDE is an independent submodule — the same
// boundary that already duplicates plans/credits-pricing from core. Keep the
// two copies in step.
//
// A palette button fires a pre-classified intent: the user has already told
// us which tool they want, so Ava must NOT re-detect intent. This turns a
// (tool, action) pair into the turn Ava receives — a short display label
// shown as the user's chat bubble, plus a directive that seeds the turn with
// the confirmed intent and the tool's required fields.
//
// See COMMAND_PALETTE_PLAN.md.
